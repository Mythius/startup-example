## Project Idea - Pickleball Tournament Website

The project I am working on this semester is a Pickleball tournament bracket / scheduling application. 

### Elevator Pitch
Pickleball is becoming a very widespread sport and is the fastest growing sport in utah. There is more and more money going into this industry, and there is currently no industry standard for pickleball tournament applications. Many people are currently organizing tornaments and schedules manually or using google sheets. So my pitch to you is that there is a need, there is money in the industry, andn there is a need for a solution.

## How I will use techonology
I will program a progresive web application using React, JS, HTML and CSS. I will have also plan on using express for my back end, and write an api that people could use on in their personal applications like google sheets. I also plan on using the google sign in api to verify users so they don't have to create a new account for this application. 

## Sketches / Mock Up of this application
I designed some sample views of this application using figma. Below are the images.
